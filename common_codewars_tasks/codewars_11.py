# There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
#
# find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
# find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
# Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
#
# The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
#
# This is the first kata in series:
#
# Find the unique number (this kata)
# Find the unique string
